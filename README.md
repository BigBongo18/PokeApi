# PokÃ©Api made with Vanilla Javascript and JQuery

This is my first time using an API, and I made it with JS and JQuery.
Feel free to download it and use it for your own purposes

### Some files are still in development, but are working properly, these are:
>style.css <br>
>api.js <br>
>detailsOfPokemon.js

### Stay tuned :)
